## Solution

Trying to log in with random credentials leads you to the "Access Denied" page. This is when a certain cookie is stored in your browser.

```
Cookie value: "cGljb0NURntjMDBrMWVfbTBuc3Rlcl9sMHZlc19jMDBraWVzXzc3MUQ1RUIwfQ%3D%3D"
```

This value seems to be a Base64 encoded string, except for the "%" signs towards the end of the string. 
The first "%" is the 63rd character of the string. 
Replacing "%3D" with "=" and decoding the string from Base64 shows the flag:

```
PS C:\Users\Akshat> ConvertFrom-Base64("cGljb0NURntjMDBrMWVfbTBuc3Rlcl9sMHZlc19jMDBraWVzXzc3MUQ1RUIwfQ==")
picoCTF{c00k1e_m0nster_l0ves_c00kies_771D5EB0}
```

Function used to decode:
```
Function ConvertFrom-Base64($base64) {
    return [System.Text.Encoding]::ASCII.GetString([System.Convert]::FromBase64String($base64))
}

```
